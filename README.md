#Census

We are a group of researchers at Stanford, MIT, U. Rochester, CMU, U. Michigan, UT Austin,
and elsewhere trying to learn more about the demographic and cognitive information regarding
the workers on Amazon's Mechanical Turks. Our package allows you to post tasks on Mechanical
Turk and then assess the demographics and cognitive skill of the workers that do your tasks.



#Brief Overview - How It Works

We attach an additional, extremely short question for the worker to answer once they have
completed your task. The results of these additional census questions regarding the workers
answering your questions are aggregated and provided for you to view through our webpage:
(COMING SOON). The results of your original task are not affected nor stored by us.


#Instructions to Use

1. Pull the /censusTool folder off the server. 

2. Add the census call to your task as follows:

	* Call `census.submit( '#questionDiv', '#taskForm', 'unique_key' );` when your task is ready to submit
		* `#questionDiv` is the empty `<div>` where the census question will be posted 
	 	* `#taskForm` is the `<form>` element that will be submitted to MTurk. 
	* The following is the code contains the `census.submit()` call that needs to be inserted into your task:


> ```
$(document).ready(function()  //Called when the document is ready to be submitted
{
	$("#submitBtn").click( function()  //Function called when submit button is pressed
	{
    		event.preventDefault();  //Prevents default response of pressing the submit button
    		$('#submitBtn').prop('disabled', 'true');  //Disables submit button
    		census.submit( '#questionDiv', '#taskForm' );  //Submits data from tasks to census server
	});
});
```

	
* DO NOT call `census.submit()` until youâ€™re ready for your task to be submitted to MTurk (as the form will be submitted to MTurk as-is once the census task is complete).
