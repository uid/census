We are a group of researchers at Stanford, MIT, U. Rochester, U. Michigan, UT Austin, and elsewhere trying to learn more about the demographic and cognitive information regarding the workers on Amazon's Mechanical Turks. 

Our package makes it easy for you to post tasks on Mechanical Turks and then assess the demographic and cognitive skills for the workers that do your tasks. We attach an additional, extremely short question for the worker to answer once they have completed your task. Afterwards, we will provide you aggregated information regarding the worker answering your tasks as well as specific information per worker. (Are we going to be providing specific information per worker?)

Example of one of our questions:
"What is your occupation?" (Which one of our questions would be most representative for what we are trying to do?)

Instructions to Use:
